In a small hut at the edge of the forest we find the hero of our tale, a branchly and forkly hero that goes by the name Git.
This is a hero like no other because, you see, Git dosn't know a thing about what it means to be a hero.
Git usualy just relax in his hut with a cool drink, in front of his computer doing what he nows best, namely pulling and pushing
others repositorys. To assist him, Git always carry with him his laptop.
By his side Git also has Shell, the problem solver. Shell is the one that Git turns to for the most tedious tasks.
